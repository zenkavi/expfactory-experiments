# The Experiment Factory Experiments

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/expfactory/expfactory-experiments.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/expfactory/expfactory-experiments)

More experiments, for a total of 80+, can be found in:
- [expfactory-surveys](http://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory-surveys)
- [expfactory-games](http://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory-games)

Each folder contains a javascript experiment that can be deployed into multiple environments, including an [experiment battery instance](http://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory-battery), a docker infrastructure ([expfactory-docker](http://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory-docker)), or just your local machine via command line with [expfactory-python](http://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory-python). You can browse the currently valid experiments [here](http://expfactory.github.io/table.html), and express your interest in experiments as a service (EaS) at [expfactory.org](http://www.expfactory.org). For details about folder contents, and generating new experiments, please see our [documentation](http://expfactory.readthedocs.org)
